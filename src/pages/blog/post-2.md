# When Is It Time for AC Maintenance?

Published on: 2025-03-31

Your air conditioning system works hard, especially during the hotter months. But like anything mechanical, it needs regular care to keep doing its job efficiently. A lot of homeowners don’t think much about their AC until it stops working, but regular maintenance can help prevent surprises and keep your system running smoothly.

## Common Signs Your AC Might Need Maintenance

If you’re not sure whether it’s time to call a professional, here are a few things to look out for:

1. **Weak airflow** — If it feels like less air is coming out of your vents than usual, it could be a sign of a clogged filter or a ductwork issue.

2. **Strange noises** — Rattling, buzzing, or grinding sounds aren’t normal. These could point to loose parts or something more serious.

3. **Uneven cooling** — Some rooms are cool, others are warm. That’s often a sign your system isn’t distributing air properly.

4. **Unusual smells** — A musty smell could mean mold in your system, while a burning smell might point to electrical issues.

5. **Higher energy bills** — If your usage hasn’t changed but your bill has, your system might be working harder than it should.

## Why Regular AC Maintenance Matters

Getting your AC serviced once a year can help catch small issues early, improve how efficiently your system runs, and make your home more comfortable overall. Regular maintenance also helps extend the life of your unit, so you don’t have to replace it sooner than necessary.

Most manufacturers even recommend or require yearly maintenance to keep the warranty valid, so it’s worth checking that too.

## What's Included in a Professional Tune-Up

Every HVAC company is different, but a standard maintenance visit usually includes:

- Cleaning the condenser and evaporator coils
- Replacing or cleaning the air filter
- Checking refrigerant levels
- Inspecting electrical components and connections
- Testing the thermostat
- Lubricating any moving parts

It’s essentially a full system check to make sure everything is working the way it should.

## Thinking About Scheduling a Visit?

If it’s been a while since your last AC service, or if you’ve noticed any of the signs above, it’s a good idea to book a tune-up. Regular maintenance doesn’t take long, and it can save you from bigger problems down the road.
