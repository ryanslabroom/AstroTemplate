    ParaOne="Over time, your AC’s coils get covered in dust, dirt, and even mold — especially in a place like Hudson with all the humidity. That build-up makes your system work harder than it needs to and costs you more in the long run. We offer coil cleaning and maintenance that clears the gunk and helps your system breathe better. It’s a simple step that makes a big difference in performance and efficiency."

    HeaderTwo="Want Lower Bills? Start with an Energy Efficiency Check"
    ParaTwo="If your home never feels quite right or your electric bill keeps climbing, we can help figure out what’s going on. Our energy efficiency assessments give you a clear look at how your HVAC system is doing. We’ll check airflow, insulation impact, system age, and more — and give you smart, honest recommendations to help you save money without sacrificing comfort."
